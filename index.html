        Pet adoption is the process of taking responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or released to a shelter or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.
        <br><br>
        Online pet adoption sites have databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups, and are searchable by the public.
