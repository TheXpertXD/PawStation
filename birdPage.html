				If you wanted to add some background noise to your home, then look no further than some of our feathery friends up for adoption! Some of these critters can live up to 80 years! 		
				There's the potential to find a lifelong companion today.

		<h3>Lets take a closer look at who wants to get adopted!</h3>

		<h2 class="center">Dranf</h2>
 		<img class="imageC" src="images/pets/brd/dranf.jpg" alt="dranf">
		<br>
		Dranf was donated to our headquarters in Boston by a dear friend of ours. He is now looking to find a lifelong friend to co-exist with! He sometimes gets his name confused so if he ever refers to himself as Antonious, its his character trait!

		<h2 class="center">Athena</h2>
		<img class="imageC" src="images/pets/brd/Athena.jpg" alt="athena">

		<br>
    <p>
      Athena just flew into our open window one day and didn't leave so we decided to help her find her way home or even find a new one!
