				We have just recently gotten approval from the city, the federal government, and a slew of animal rights organizations to offer monkeys as a friend that you can take home with you! After we ensure it goes to a good home and a good owner, you can have your very own monkey to get into all sorts of hijinks with!

		Gadget is a spider monkey who just loves to climb up as high as he can! Make sure you have lots of objects that go up high so Gadget can soar to his hearts' content!
