		<h3>Lets take a closer look at who wants to get adopted!</h3>

	<h2 class="center">Kira</h2>
    <img class="imageC" src="images/pets/cat/Kira.jpg" alt="kira">
		<br>
		Kira is a tabby cat that was found roaming the exterior of our headquarters in Boston. The poor guy was chewing hungrily on a half-eaten sandwhich in a brown paper bag, practically asking to be rescued. After being cleaned and 
	  given medical attention where it was required, Kira is ready to home with any lucky potential owner.

		<h2 class="center">Merry</h2>
	  <img class="imageC" src="images/pets/cat/Merry.jpg" alt="merry">

		<br>
    <p>
      Merry was given to us by an estranged owner who couldn't afford to properly care for her anymore. If you would like to take home this mysterious, blue-eyed cat home with you, feel free to contact us through the information on our site!
